# Challenge-13-eCommerce-Backend
The student assignment of the ESMT Coding Boot Camp is to build the backend for an e-commerce site, using Express.js, Sequelize, and a MySQL database. The assignment was completed with a test of CRUD operations using Insomnia and a video submission showing the results. 

## Snapshot
The following images and videos show the Insomnia tests of GET route for products and PUT route for categories.
